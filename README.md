# eversync
Uses Tumblr and Evernote API to save content from Tumblr to Evernote. 

# Background
I've been on a productivity kick lately, and I'm in love with Evernote. I follow a lot of blogs on Tumblr and mainly use the 'like' function as a 'read me later'. I've amassed over a thousand liked posts, so I decided to find a way to save my likes from Tumblr to Evernote so that they were searchable and (most importantly) available offline so I could read everything during my daily commute. 

This was my first time working with a non-programming language API so I used a Codecademy tutorial to figure out the basics. They have tutorials for tons of APIs and it's really a great way to get started! Check it out [here](https://www.codecademy.com/apis) ! 

# How to use
Download the zip and add your authtokens/keys in the respective places in the tbauth.rb and evernoteapi.rb. Then, run script.rb in the terminal. You'll need to get an authorization token from both [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/dev_tokens.php) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps).
